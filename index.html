      Carbon dioxide is essential to plant growth. Carbon dioxide in its purest form is a gas, but like oxygen it can be readily 
      disolved in water. Aquatic plants utilize this disolved carbon dioxide to photosynthesize in a similar way that grass or 
      a tree in a garden would do. Diffusers use membranes or reactors to dissolve drops of gaseous CO2 directly into the aquarium 
      water, artificially creating the perfect environment for aquascaping.
